			<h1>Conditional Commands - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Conditional Commands</strong>
				chapter of the Shell Scripting training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>
The purpose of these exercises is develop shell scripts that make decisions and execute
different commands based on those decisions.
</p>
<ol>

<li><h2><a id="Shell"/>Shell</h2>
<p>
Write a script that will indicate if the login shell is the Korn Shell (check 
the value of the variable <b>$SHELL</b>). Make sure your scrpt works whether the
Korn shell is installed as <b>/bin/ksh</b>, <b>/usr/bin/ksh</b> or some other location.
</p>
<p>Extend your script to say if the login shell is
the Korn shell, Bash or another shell; for the latter print out the script name
that is being used as the shell.
</p>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Home"/>At Home</h2>
<p>
Write a script that will indicate if the current directory is the user's home
directory. Do this initially by comparing variable values, and then write a
second version that uses the <b>pwd</b>
command to obtain the current working directory.
</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Home">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Greeting"/>Greetings</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Write a script that prompts the user to enter their name. Exit silently (with an 
error status) if the read fails;
this will happen if the user types <b>^D</b> rather than supply their name. If the user supplies a name display a simple
greeting like <b>Hello </b><i>name</i> otherwise display an error message saying that no name
was supplied. Make sure your error is written to standard error and exit with an error status.
</li>
<li>Write a second script that will
run the script you developed in the previous question and have it display an error message 
to standard error if the script fails.
</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Greeting">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="File"/>File Check</h2>
<p>
Write a script that will use the first command line argument as
a pathname and display a message to
indicate whether this files exists, and if so if its a plain file, a directory
of another type of file. Ignore any additional command line arguments and silently exit
with an error status if no argument is supplied. Do this in two ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>by using multiple <b>if</b> commands</li>
<li>by combining commands with <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and not using an <b>if</b> command</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="solutions.html#File">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Numbers"/>Number Range</h2>
<p>Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number and then
validate that the number is between 1 and 10. Display the number if it
is within the valid range otherwise write an error message.</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Numbers">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Search"/>Safe Search</h2>
<p>Write a script that wraps around <b>grep</b> to provide a <i>simpler</i> interface 
to using the command. Your script should:</p>
<ul>
<li>accept a command line of the format <b>search <i>pattern</i> <i>files...</i></b></li>
<li>run a letter case insensitive search</li>
<li>support patterns starting with <b>-</b> by supplying the <b>--</b> option to <b>grep</b></li>
<li>ensure at least one filename is provided</li>
</ul>
