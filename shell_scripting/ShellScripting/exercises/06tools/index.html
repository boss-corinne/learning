			<h1>Power Tools - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Power Tools</strong>
				chapter of the Shell Scripting training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>
The purpose of these exercises is to review the use of Linux filter commands, in particular
searching text with <b>grep</b>, editing text with <b>sed</b> and finding files with <b>find</b>.
</p>
<p>
The first three questions do not require you to write any shell scripts, they are
command review questions designed to reinforce your understanding of the 
<b>grep</b>, <b>sed</b> and <b>find</b> commands.
If you are familiar with these commands you may prefer to start at question four.  
</p>
<ol>
</ol><div><h3>Command Review</h3></div><ol>
<li><h2><a id="Patterns"/>Search Patterns</h2>
<p>
The sample data file <b>words.txt</b> in the <a href="../../data">data</a> directory is a dictionary of
British English words with each line containing a single word. Linux/Unix systems usually have a 
similar file called <b>/usr/share/dict/words</b>.
</p>
<p>Using the supplied <b>words.txt</b> file as a data source supply <b>grep</b> patterns that will 
match the patterns in the list below; you will need to use <b>grep -E</b> or <b>egrep</b>
to match some of the patterns. 
Remember that you should put single quotes around the pattern to disable shell expansion of
special characters such as <b>[ ?</b> and <b>$</b> :</p>
<ol>
	<li>All words containing the text "look"</li>
	<li>Words starting with "q"</li>
	<li>Words ending with "j"</li>
	<li>Words starting with "a" and ending with "z"</li>
	<li>Words where "e" comes before "i"</li>
	<li>Words containing any of "x", "y" or "z"</li>
	<li>Words containing the letters "t" "h" "e" consecutively</li>
	<li>Words with at least two consecutive vowels</li>
	<li>Words with exactly 4 characters</li>
    <li>Words containing "all" but not "ally" - this isn't as straightforward as you may think</li>
	<li>Words with exactly one hyphen</li>
	<li>Any words where all the vowels appear in alphabetical order, each vowel may occur more than once</li>
	<li>Words containing a <b>-g</b> pattern - when using <b>grep</b> from the command line this isn't as easy as it appears</li>
</ol>

<li><h2><a id="SED"/>Stream Editing</h2>
<p>Using the file <a href='../../data/hamlet.txt' target='file'>hamlet.txt</a> in the sample
<a href='../../data' target='data'>data files</a> directory enter <b>sed</b> commands to do the
following:
<ol>
<li>print the first three lines</li>
<li>delete all lines containing the word <i>sleep</i></li>
<li>print only those lines containing <i>sleep</i></li>
<li>replace <i>die</i> with <i>big sleep</i> on all lines</li>
<li>replace <i>die</i> with <i>big sleep</i> and dream with <i>speculate</i> on all lines but using a single <b>sed</b> command</li>
<li>a slightly tricky one next: print lines starting with <i>The</i> but replace any commas from the line with semi-colons</li>
<li>and a very tricky one to finish: print out only those lines between the line containing the 
word <i>perchance</i> and the line containing the word <i>calamity</i> (there will be five lines in the output but don't assume that).
</li>
</ol>

<li><h2><a id="Findexec"/>Finding Files</h2>
<p>Make sure you have a copy of the file <b>jabber.txt</b> somewhere in your home directory
tree.
From your home directory use the <b>find</b> command with <b>-exec</b> or <b>-ok</b> options to 
solve the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a long listing of all files</li>
<li>Provide a long listing of all files larger than 4k (4096 bytes)</li>
<li>Find all tmp files (names ending <b>.tmp</b>) and prompt to delete them 
(it's up to you whether you delete them or not)</li>
<li>This is tricky: find all text files (names ending <b>*.txt</b>)
containing the string <b>Jabber</b> or <b>jabber</b> and then 
page these files using <b>more</b> (or <b>less</b>) - you should discard any error messages
and use <b>grep -l</b> to stop <b>grep</b> from listing the lines containing the matched text</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol><div><h3>Scripts that use Power Tools</h3></div><ol>
<li><h2><a id="Filesystem"/>Filesystem Usage</h2>
<p>Study the output from the command <b>df -P</b> where <b>-P</b> is for POSIX compliance which ensures each filesystem's
information is shown on a single line and not potentially formatted across multiple lines. 
</p><p>
Using this output write a script 
that displays the five filesystems with the highest percentage usage value (hint the <b>-n</b> option 
to <b>sort</b> can be used to sort by the number before the percentage sign).</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Filesystem">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Directory"/>Directory Listing</h2>
<p>
Write a script that will accept a list of pathnames on the command line and
print the pathname for all files except directories. For directories print the
pathname followed by the number of non hidden files in the directory shown
in square brackets. You will need to use <b>wc -l</b> to count files 
listed by <b>ls</b> and use <b>sed</b>
to strip whitespace from the start of the line count produced by <b>wc</b>.
</p>
<p>
Your output should be similar to:
</p><pre>
Desktop [2]
Documents [5]
Download [0]
jabber.txt
Music [0]
</pre>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Directory">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="FFFix"/>Fix Firefox</h2>
<p>
Write a single command that will use <b>ps</b> and <b>grep</b> to get a list of running firefox
processes, make sure you exclude the <b>grep</b> command from this list. Use <b>cut</b>
to obtain the PIDs of the running processes and use <b>kill</b> to send 
the default terminate signal to stop firefox (don't use <b>kill -9</b> as it doesn't allow firefox
to tidy up and remove any working files). 
</p>
<p>
As you are using firefox for these exercises you may want to open a PDF file with <b>evince</b>
and then kill this process instead.
</p>
<p>
Now incorprorate this command into a script that will
allow the user to supply one or more program names on the
command line and kill each of these programs. Default to using <b>firefox</b> (or <b>evince</b>) 
if no arguments are supplied. Have the script print out a message
to say if each programs was running and was terminated, or if it was not running.

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Usage"/>Disk Usage</h2>
<p>Write a script that will use the <b>wc -c</b> and <b>find</b>
commands to recursively search a directory and display the size of 
all plain files in bytes
(number of characters). Allow the user to supply one or more filenames
on the command line and default to the current directory if no command
arguments are supplied. Sort the list of files so that the largest file is displayed first
and only display the 10 largest files.
