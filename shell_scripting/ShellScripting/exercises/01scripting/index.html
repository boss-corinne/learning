			<h1>Introduction to Shell Scripts - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Introduction to Shell Scripts</strong>
				chapter of the Shell Scripting training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>
The purpose of these exercises is to create and execute simple shell scripts. You will find it
beneficial to create a working directory for this course and place your scripts in that directory.
</p>

<li><h2><a id="Login"/>Login to Linux</h2>
<p>
Your instructor will provide you with login details for your environment. You
will need to know:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>your <b>username</b></li>
	<li>your <b>password</b></li>
	<li>the <b>hostname</b> if you are using SSH</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using this information login using one of the following alternatives
dependent upon your training environment:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
If you have a Linux Desktop environment login through the desktop
and launch a Terminal window or xterm window as demonstrated by
the instructor.</p></li>
<li><p>
If you are using a Microsoft Windows PC then start an SSH client as demonstrated
by the instructor and login to the Linux server.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
From the shell prompt how do you identify your default shell - are you using Bash or
one of the Korn Shells?</p>

<li><h2><a id="Script"/>Writing a Shell Script</h2>
<p>Perform the following actions which will help you understand how to write and run shell
scripts:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a single command line run multiple commands to
create a working directory for this exercise and then
change to this new working directory.</li> 
<li>In this working directory write a shell script that will display the path of the 
current directory and then a long listing of the current directory - make sure
you don't give the script the same name as a standard command (something
like <b>pls</b> would work).</li>
<li>Execute your shell script by passing it as a parameter to the default shell (<b>/bin/sh</b>).</li>
<li>Make your shell script executable and run it using a relative path name (don't rely on the 
current directory being on the search path).</li>
<li>Modify your search path to append the working directory containing your script and then 
run your script just by typing its name.</li>
<li>Add a <i>shebang</i> comment to the start of the script to specify which shell you want to use: choose
the correct absolute pathname for either <b>ksh</b> or <b>bash</b> according to your 
shell preference. You will need to use the <b>type</b> or <b>whence</b> command to
find the location of the executable for your shebang line. Run your script - you may want to add
a command to the script to display which shell is used to run the script.</li>
<li>Update your script to pipe the <b>ls</b> output through either <b>more</b> or <b>less</b>,
check your script works with a large directory such as <b>/usr/bin</b>.</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Debug"/>Shell Debugging</h2>
<p>Create a shell script called <b>features</b> with the following lines:
</p><pre>
date
echo Current directory: $PWD
ls -l *
ls -l ~ | grep '^d' | more
</pre><p>
Using this script work through the following steps: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Run your preferred shell and pass this script as a command line argument.</li>
	<li>Run the same command line as before but supply the shell's <b>-n</b> option and explain
	why there is no output.</li>	
	<li>Run the original command but this time use the <b>-v</b> option and explain
	the output.</li>
	<li>Finally run the original command with the <b>-x</b> option and explain
	the output.</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Reverse"/>Reverse Words</h2>
<p>Write a script that prompts the user to enter a line of data, read the words on this line 
into three variables from the user and then display
the words in reverse order. Don't worry if the user enters more or less than three words,
simply display the three variables in reverse order.</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Reverse">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Environment"/>Shell Environment</h2>
<p>Create the following script called <b>setwh</b>
that will change create a new environment variable called WORK_HOME and the 
display the value of this variable both before and after setting its value:
</p><pre>
echo "work home = $WORK_HOME"
export WORK_HOME=~/work
env | grep WORK_HOME
</pre><p>
Now work through the following steps and explain how the different ways of executing a shell
script affect the environment used to define the WORK_HOME variable:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure that the WORK_HOME variable is not set in the current shell 
(use <b>unset</b> to do this).</p></li>
<li><p>Use your preferred shell to run this script and supply a new directory. For example:
	</p><pre>ksh setwh</pre><p>
	Verify that it displays out the value of WORK_HOME correctly. Now display the value of this
	variable using </p><pre>echo $WORK_HOME</pre><p> it won't be defined, why is this?
</p></li>
<li><p>How would you run the <b>setwh</b> script so that it defines WORK_HOME in the current
shell?</p></li>
</ol>
