			<h1>Variables in Scripts - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Variables in Scripts</strong>
				chapter of the Shell Scripting training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>
The purpose of these exercises is look at techniques for using variables within shell scripts.
</p>
<ol>

<li><h2><a id="Reverse"/>Reverse Arguments</h2>
<p>Write a script that will display the first three command line arguments
in reverse order. Don't worry if there are more or less than three arguments 
on the command line, simply display as many as possible of the first three in reverse order.</p>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="SmartList"/>Smarter Listing</h2>
<p>Write a script that will run  the <b>ls -l</b> command using all the command
line arguments supplied to the script. Page the output through the user's preferred
pager program or <b>more</b> if this isn't defined.</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#SmartList">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Capture"/>Command Capture</h2>
<p>Write a script that will capture the output from the <b>date</b> command where
the current date is written in the format <b>YYYYMMDD-HHMM</b> (you'll need
to read the manual page for <b>date</b> to work out how to format the output).
Now save a long listing of the current directory to file whose name is this
date string with a <b>.log</b> suffix (<i>date</i><b>.log</b>). Try and do this in
a single command.</p>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Automate"/>Automated Development</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Write a script that will let you edit a file and then run that file as a shell script using your preferred
shell, pass the name of the file as the first command line argument to your script. 
You should allow the user (yourself) to use environment variables to define which
editor to use (use the standard EDITOR variable) and the required shell interpreter (use your own variable
such as INTERPRETER). Your script should use <b>vi</b> and <b>ksh</b> as defaults if the user
does not define the variables.
</li>
<li>Use the no-operation command to set the values for your two configuration 
variables if you did not do so in your previous solution. Also, save the first script argument into 
a variable rather than use it directly in the two commands.</li>
</ol>
